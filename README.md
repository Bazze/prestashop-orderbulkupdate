prestashop-orderbulkupdate
==========================

A PrestaShop module for bulk updating order information

# Disclaimer
This is an old PrestaShop module I did a couple of years ago. Maybe someone could find it useful. If I remember correctly it should be working for PrestaShop version 1.4.x.

Feel free to do anything you want with this. MIT license.

## INSTALL
How to install the module:

1. Copy the folder "orderbulkupdate" to your modules directory or use the 'Add a module from my computer'
button that is shown in the modules page and select the orderbulkupdate.zip.
2. Go to the Modules tab in your back office and click Install on this module.
3. Go to 'Orders > Bulk update' to use the module.
